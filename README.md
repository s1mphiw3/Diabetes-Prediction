# Diabetes-Prediction

**Overview** The study aims to utilize machine learning models to predict the likelihood of developing diabetes, with the goal of reducing the number of Swazis diagnosed at advanced stages, given the limitations of healthcare resources in Eswatini.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and handling missing values. Data Reduction. Data Transformation using a min-max scaler.
Model Training: Implementation of various classification models (e.g. Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network and Gradient Boosting Classifier). Model selection and hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Evaluation metrics used Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-Score and Learning Curve. 
Model Deployment: The model was then deployed so that we can be able to test its prediction database with real life data.
